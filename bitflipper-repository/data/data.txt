A geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic  
 north and magnetic south are interchanged (not to be confused with geographic north and geographic south).
  The Earth's field has alternated between periods of normal polarity, in which the predominant direction
   f the field was the same as the present direction, and reverse polarity, in which it was the opposite.
   These periods are called chrons.

Reversal occurrences are statistically random. There have been 183 reversals over the last 83
 million years (on average once every ~450,000 years). The latest, the Brunhesâ€“Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000
  years ago,[1] with widely varying estimates of how quickly it happned. Other sources estimate that the time that
  it takes for a reversal to complete is on average around 7,000 years for the four most recent reversals.
  Clement (2004) suggests that this duration is dependent on latitude, with shorter durations at low latitudes,
   and longer durations at mid and high latitudes. Although variable, the duration of a full reversal
   is typically between 2,000 and 12,000 years.

Although there have been periods in which the field reversed globally (such as the Laschamp excursion)
 for several hundred years, these events are classified as excursions rather than full geomagnetic
 reversals. Stable polarity chrons often show large, rapid directional excursions, which occur more
  often than reversals, and could be een as failed reversals. During such an excursion, the field
 reverses in the liquid outer core, but not in the solid inner core. Diffusion in the liquid outer
  core is on timescales of 500 years or less, while that of the solid iner core is longer, around 3,000 years.
